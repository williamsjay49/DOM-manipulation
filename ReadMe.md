### DOM-manipulation

Scoping and DOM manipulation is a tricky concept to grasp in Javascript.

I took on this project to further reinforce my existing knowledge of the DOM.

Project Description.

1. User set a series of move command for the box using key presses.
2. "right arrow key", "left arrow key", "down arrow key", "up arrow key", and "c" key which is used to randomly change the element's color.
3. User invoke the setTimout function by pressing the "enter or space key".
4. User can also remove any movement they want because this automatically shows up on display while user set them directions.

I would love your contributions on this project.
Thanks for checking out my repo.
